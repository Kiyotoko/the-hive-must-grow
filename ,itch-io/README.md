<h1>The Hive Must Grow</h1>
<p>A really wonderful cozy game! Dive into the word of bees and help them build an entire empire. You can send off worker bees, who collect ressources to grow your city. Of course the queen can't be missed, she's keeping the city running if you're not around ;) But careful what you feed the queen.</p>

<h2>Buildings</h2>

Please note that you need to pay different the resources to build any building and that you can only place a building if have enough space on the area you click (means you can not place a building if there is already another building or a tree).</p>
